I now have 10 'apps' and/or shortcuts on my phone homescreen.

I find I probably invest the most 'micro-seconds' in my phone, constantly checking here and there. Those minutes add up.

The less I have on my phone, the less I use my phone, the more time I create to do other things.

Favorites: Phone, SMS, Email, Browser, Camera
Apps/Shortcuts: Calculator, Clock, Calendar, Web-Based Metronome, Music

I also have a date/time/weather widget.

I have spent countless hours scrolling through my phone, reading a ton of interesting stuff, forgetting a lot of it, and suffering from general informationn overload and lowered attention span.

It's only been a few days since I decided to practice a bit more extreme technical minimalism.

I've found my free time has increased a very significant amount, boosting my happiness and personal productivity.

Now that I'm not constantly checking for updates, I spend more time doing the things I enjoy: namely practicing music.

Of course there are other things I do in my free time, but now I have more free time for those as well!

I didn't just boost my musical productivity, I boosted my overall productivity. I feel less useless, and more mindful.

This has resulted in an upward boost in my mood.

Note: I didn't just delete the time-consuming apps from my phone. I didn't just 'deactivate and maybe reactivate later'. I deleted my user-accounts, and I feel much better because of it.

Yes, I still constantly check my phone.
