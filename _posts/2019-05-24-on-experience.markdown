I am far from experienced.

I make mistakes all the time. I often don't know the best way to approach problems.

However, I've been writing code now professionally for about 3 years. Like I said - far from experienced.

Over these last few years I feel like I've come a very long way. On my first job, I was terrified of under-performing and being fired for making a mistake. As time went on, that fear started to evaporate. As I gathered small wins - getting through training, then code reviews, then actually committing code - my confidence grew.

Later, learning new systems on the fly, leading a small team, having little direction and a lot of leeway, my confidence continued to grow. Promoting changes to the production system, even modifying production data, have always made me very nervous. But, every time it happens, I sock away that small win.

After working on significant parts of larger systems, my perspective has changed. Simply writing software no longer seems so difficult. Once the requirements are gathered and there's a clear goal set, it's easy to move forward.

I'm starting to see systems as a whole, rather than their smaller pieces and parts. The whole thing has become a giant jigsaw puzzle with this and that piece fitting together in just the right way. I believe the challenge now is to design good pieces that fit together nicely to create a whole system. A system that's easy to change, easy to extend, and efficient.

Outside of work, I've started to treat many of my day-to-day problems the same way I treat software problems. I break them into small, manageable tasks. I remind myself there's multiple solutions to every problem - some are better than others. Most importantly, there's no such thing as perfection. 

Any solution can be improved. Any situation can be improved. There's always time to go back and fix what's broken. If I need to reach out for help, I do.

Bad things happen all the time, the key for me is to remain positive. Even in the most desperate times.

Running into a problem that has me spinning my gears for a while and trying out multiple solutions until I get it right, or close enough - over and over day in and day out. My patience and persistence have become powertools.

I'm no longer terrified of getting fired. I am still afraid to make mistakes, which holds me back from taking risk at times.

I haven't lost the joy of watching a command prompt puke, and I hope I never do. I'm in the process of trying to get ruby and jekyll updated and running locally - so I can test this post. It may seem tedious to some, but I'm genuinely enjoying myself. Trying different commands, reading the cryptic error messages, trying the same thing over and over.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

It doesn't work, some commands are typed into the console, the console pukes. This process repeats itself a few times.

And then it works! How about that!

A lot of great people work on the tools we use every day, and under the hood I'm sure they're incredibly complex and well thought (the tools _and_ the people). However, sometimes it's fun to remain ignorant of all the small details, and simply be happy the console is telling me something new this time.

It's better for me to focus on process instead of product. Enjoy the moment while it lasts, and then enjoy the next when it comes. Don't live in the past, don't expect anything from the future.

Remain positive, persistent, patient, and imperfect.

I'm excited to see what the next few years will bring in terms of growth.
